Mac Doctor: Requirements Specification

Overview

‚ÄúMac Doctor‚Äù is a Python-based agentic AI assistant designed to analyze the current performance and health of a macOS system, diagnose issues, and suggest actions. It leverages local system diagnostic tools (e.g., ps, top, dtrace, vm_stat, iostat, and others) and feeds collected metrics into a locally running Gemini-compatible LLM (Flash 2.5 model) to provide user-friendly recommendations. The agent dynamically selects which tools to invoke based on the problem it‚Äôs asked to solve.

‚∏ª

Goals
	1.	Consumer-/Hobbyist-Friendly tool.
	2.	Provide an actionable diagnostic report about Mac performance issues.
	3.	Offer interactive recommendations with confirmations for suggested actions (e.g., kill a runaway process).
	4.	Be agent-driven: capable of answering arbitrary user queries by calling a set of modular toolchains.
	5.	Maintain privacy (all data and model runs locally).

‚∏ª

System Requirements
	‚Ä¢	macOS 12 or later (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.10+
	‚Ä¢	Gemini Flash 2.5-compatible inference runtime (e.g., gemini-python + local model)
	‚Ä¢	Dependencies:
	‚Ä¢	langchain or langgraph (for agent orchestration)
	‚Ä¢	psutil
	‚Ä¢	subprocess
	‚Ä¢	rich (for output formatting)
	‚Ä¢	typer or argparse (for CLI)
	‚Ä¢	gemini-python SDK (local model)
	‚Ä¢	(optional) matplotlib or plotext for graphs

Architecture

Agent-Centric Workflow

The agent should be implemented using LangChain or another agentic framework that enables:
	‚Ä¢	Tool-based planning: given a question or directive (e.g., ‚ÄúWhy is my Mac slow?‚Äù), the agent plans and executes a series of steps using tools.
	‚Ä¢	Pluggable tools (MCPs): Each diagnostic component (e.g., ps, dtrace, vm_stat) is exposed as a modular callable tool.
	‚Ä¢	Memory (optional): cache recent diagnostics to avoid repeating steps.
	‚Ä¢	Autonomous or conversational mode.

1. Tools (MCPs)

Each diagnostic interface is implemented as a modular Mac Collector Plugin (MCP):
	‚Ä¢	ps_mcp: Lists top CPU/memory processes using psutil and ps
	‚Ä¢	dtrace_mcp: Runs and summarizes a specific DTrace script (e.g., syscall count, file access, latency)
	‚Ä¢	xrg_mcp: Integrates with or mimics Stats/XRG output via system commands
	‚Ä¢	vmstat_mcp: Reports memory pressure and paging behavior
	‚Ä¢	disk_mcp: Uses iostat, df, and du to analyze disk I/O and free space
	‚Ä¢	logs_mcp: Reads and summarizes recent system logs
	‚Ä¢	net_mcp: Summarizes network activity (nettop, netstat)
	‚Ä¢	Each MCP is self-contained, outputs structured JSON, and can be registered/unregistered

2. Diagnostic Agent (LLM Integration)
	‚Ä¢	Implemented with LangChain‚Äôs agent interface
	‚Ä¢	Input: user question or default prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúDiagnose Mac slowness‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Agent dynamically calls MCPs and aggregates results
	‚Ä¢	Output from MCPs is embedded into prompts to Gemini Flash 2.5 model via gemini-python
	‚Ä¢	LLM responds with:
	‚Ä¢	Issue analysis
	‚Ä¢	Root cause(s)
	‚Ä¢	Actionable fixes

3. Recommendation Interpreter
	‚Ä¢	Parses LLM output
	‚Ä¢	Proposes safe actions (e.g., kill PID, sudo purge, disable Spotlight)
	‚Ä¢	Uses confirmation prompt before execution
	‚Ä¢	Logs actions taken

4. CLI Interface
	‚Ä¢	Entry point for invoking the agent

$ python mac_doctor.py diagnose

	‚Ä¢	Modes:
	‚Ä¢	diagnose: general analysis
	‚Ä¢	ask "<question>": arbitrary user query (e.g., ‚ÄúWhy is fan loud?‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	list-tools: show registered MCPs
	‚Ä¢	trace: run a trace-only debug

‚∏ª

Output Format
	‚Ä¢	Markdown-formatted report (print to terminal and optionally export)
	‚Ä¢	JSON output available with --json
	‚Ä¢	Includes:
	‚Ä¢	Detected Issues
	‚Ä¢	Tool results
	‚Ä¢	Suggested Fixes (with command options)

‚∏ª

Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
	‚Ä¢	GUI menu-bar app
	‚Ä¢	Natural language remediation commands
	‚Ä¢	GPT-4o or Claude 3 as backends
	‚Ä¢	Integration with system_profiler
	‚Ä¢	Autonomous monitoring agent

‚∏ª

Privacy & Security Considerations
	‚Ä¢	No remote data transfer
	‚Ä¢	Local model use only
	‚Ä¢	Clear indication before any sudo command or destructive action

‚∏ª

Example Prompt and Flow
	1.	User: Why is my Mac slow today?
	2.	Agent loads plan:
	‚Ä¢	Run ps_mcp, vmstat_mcp, disk_mcp, dtrace_mcp
	3.	Data fed into Gemini Flash 2.5
	4.	LLM output:

üõ† Problem: Kernel_task using excessive CPU (likely thermal management)
üí° Recommendation: Check ambient temperature, disconnect extra monitors, clean vents
‚ùì Suggestion: Kill runaway helper process (PID 2314)? [Y/n]
