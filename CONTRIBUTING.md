# Contributing to Mac Doctor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mac Doctor! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MacDoctor.git
   cd MacDoctor
   ```

2. **Set up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   # Run tests to ensure everything works
   pytest
   
   # Try the CLI
   mac-doctor --help
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=mac_doctor --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_process_mcp.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests
- All new code should include comprehensive tests
- Tests should cover success cases, error conditions, and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Mock external dependencies (system commands, network calls, etc.)

Example test structure:
```python
class TestNewFeature:
    def test_feature_success_case(self):
        """Test that feature works correctly under normal conditions."""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
        
    def test_feature_error_handling(self):
        """Test that feature handles errors gracefully."""
        # Test error scenarios
```

## üé® Code Style

### Formatting
We use automated code formatting tools:

```bash
# Format code
black mac_doctor/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort mac_doctor/ tests/

# Run linting
flake8 mac_doctor/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy mac_doctor/
```

### Style Guidelines
- **Line Length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Imports**: Use isort with black-compatible profile
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names, avoid abbreviations

### Example Code Style
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

def analyze_system_data(
    data: Dict[str, Any], 
    threshold: float = 0.8
) -> Optional[List[str]]:
    """Analyze system data and return recommendations.
    
    Args:
        data: System metrics dictionary
        threshold: Performance threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
        
    Returns:
        List of recommendations or None if no issues found
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If threshold is out of range
    """
    if not 0.0 <= threshold <= 1.0:
        raise ValueError("Threshold must be between 0.0 and 1.0")
    
    # Implementation here
    return recommendations
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Mac Collector Plugins (MCPs)
When creating new MCPs:

1. **Inherit from BaseMCP**
   ```python
   from mac_doctor.interfaces import BaseMCP, MCPResult
   
   class NewMCP(BaseMCP):
       @property
       def name(self) -> str:
           return "descriptive_name"
   ```

2. **Implement Required Methods**
   - `is_available()`: Check if MCP can run
   - `execute()`: Collect and return data
   - `get_schema()`: Return parameter schema

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always return `MCPResult` objects
   - Handle missing tools gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Testing**
   - Mock system commands and external dependencies
   - Test availability checking
   - Test successful execution and error cases

### LLM Providers
When adding new LLM providers:

1. **Inherit from BaseLLM**
2. **Implement required methods**
3. **Handle API keys securely**
4. **Support privacy mode**
5. **Add comprehensive tests**
